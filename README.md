## 🚀 About The Project

This portfolio serves as a central hub to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a **CSE Undergraduate**. It is designed completely with help of Gemini. It uses html5 for basic website structuring.CSS3 have been used for custom styling and animation. Js have been used for making the hamburger menu in mobile experience. After creating the frontend of the website it have been deployed using firebase. I had to download node.js and use CLI to deploy the website.
